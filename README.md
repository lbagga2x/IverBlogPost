# iOS Blog Test Project #

If you find you need an admin user for any API calls, we created: user@iversoft.ca / Ivers0ft

The API is documented in the "DEV-API-Documentation" pdf.


## Tasks ##

The first task is to get the app to build and run.
The second task is to add new functionality: the ability to create new blog posts. 


## Things to consider ##

We would like to see a combination of troubleshooting the existing code, but also creating new features. Don't get so hung up on fixing the app that you don't get to the new features!
If you need to disable existing features because troubleshooting them is taking too much time, please do so. 
Please make reasonable assumptions about how you'd like the new feature to work, considering the time available.
Please aim to submit the completed test within about 3 days (don't worry, you are not expected to spend the entire 3 days coding)


## Please document ##

- Approximately how many hours you spent
- Any existing features that you chose to disable, or tradeoffs you made, with rationale.
- Any additional work that you would have liked to implement but weren't able to within the given time frame. 
- A time estimate to complete remaining work: ie. troubleshoot disabled features and complete the new feature to your satisfaction. 
- Any issues you ran into (ie. if the API didn't function as expected, and so on)
- Optional: a wishlist of things to refactor in the code base.
